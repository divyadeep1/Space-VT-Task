# Space-VT-Task
Hello people!
This is the task required by Space@VT for being eligible to participate in GSOC 2018, working for Space@VT. I have taken up the 'Analyzing the Disturbance storm time (Dst) index' project's tasks. I have, as of now, scrapped the values from the given website (upto January, 2018) and have written them to an SQLite3 database. I am also planning to make a visualization tool (and hopefully a machine learning model) based on the scrapped data. All feedback is welcome.
